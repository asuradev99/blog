    <p>It&#39;s often a given that we should take notes. But is this true? How should I take notes, if at all? I think
      the answer depends on a number of factors, such as the kind of class I am taking and also the resources the
      teacher provides. Conventional wisdom says pick the strategy that fits your learning style, but I want to go more
      into detail on this and focus on stuff that is less nebulous. </p>
    <p>For my purposes I will focus on the issue of taking notes in STEM / math-heavy / practice-oriented classes, as
      those are more relevant to my situation. I will focus on the extremes (taking comprehensive notes and not taking
      any notes), and then come up with a comprimise between the two that I want to try</p>
    <h2 id="reasons-to-take-comprehensive-notes">Reasons to take comprehensive notes</h2>
    <p>This is the strategy I have been following for most of my life. </p>
    <p>Taking notes: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Better for remembering stuff without the context of a problem </li>
      <li>Better for recalling stuff after class is done</li>
      <li>Can be neater and more concise than the material provided</li>
      <li>Better for putting things in a format that is specific to your understanding of the material, not someone
        else&#39;s</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Much more time - this is the biggest disadvantage, means there is less time to do practice problems and read
        the material before lecture</li>
      <li>Harder on the wrist</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="reasons-to-not-take-comprehensive-notes">Reasons to not take comprehensive notes</h2>
    <p>Don&#39;t take notes (rely on lecture notes): </p>
    <ul>
      <li>MUCH less time required to get through the reading material</li>
      <li>More time to do practice problems</li>
      <li>Might be able concentrate on understanding lecture better </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hard to recall little details that the professor says but doesn&#39;t write down</li>
      <li>Less convenient to recall information long-term</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="compromise-take-summary-notes-not-comprehensive">Compromise: Take Summary Notes, not comprehensive</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Notes should be designed as a quick reference for solving problems<ul>
          <li>No derivations, those should be performed as practice problems or referenced as-needed from the textbook
          </li>
          <li>For important examples, write down the setup of the example/key results, but not the derivation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>No latex: learning curve is too high, takes too much time otherwise </li>
      <li>If something has detailed notes already available, only take summary / cheat sheets notes, not detailed notes
      </li>
      <li>If something has a textbook, take summary notes BEFORE lecture</li>
      <li><strong>8.05</strong> Summary notes of lectures &amp; textbooks, use Zwiebach for reading comprehension then
        do all the practice problems in Zwiebach and Griffiths<ul>
          <li>Linear algebra: summary notes of important theorems</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong><em>8.231</em></strong> Summary notes of Simon before lecture, try to do all practice problems</li>
      <li><strong>3.010</strong> We&#39;ll see</li>
      <li><strong><em>6.390</em></strong> Take summary notes from introml.com/notes</li>
      <li><em>EC.701</em>: google doc</li>
    </ul>
