    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Stop using GrubHub!</strong> GrubHub is very expensive and unsustainable. Instead, I should look into
          meal prep and a fridge. Additionally, I can also go to Trader Joes more to buy ready-made meals and cheaper
          snacks that I can eat if I miss the dining hall, though this is also not ideal.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Exercise and take a shower every day before sleep!</strong> Exercising is perhaps the single most
          reliable way I have found to go to sleep, especially when I am stressed. Without it, I will usually get a
          headache and won&#39;t get enough sleep to go to bed. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Sleep consistently every day</strong>. This one is obvious -- I already outlined it in an earlier
          post. Sleep from 2-3 am to 8 am every day. The goal is not to sleep long, but rather to sleep well, even if 
          it is only for 5-6 hours. I will try and use my Sleep tracker app to keep track of this. The
          biggest issue is looking at my phone/audiobook before bed. Regarding this, I will try to tire myself out doing
          work or exercise before bed so I am too tired to listen to an audiobook. Also <i>USE AN ALARM CLOCK!!</i></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>General hygiene, such as deodorant, nails, cleaning room, brushing hair, etc.</strong> Dedicate some
          time each week to do this</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Eat at consistent times every day.</strong> This is a big one -- I used to get extremely hungry in the 
        middle of the night because I would skip breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which would fuel my sleep problems. Thus, 
        it is imperative I eat 3 meals a day, even if it means spending a little bit more. No amount of extra studying /
        staying up late is worth starving for. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Look into Community Service / Dedicated Extracurricular</strong>. Potentially some form of
          volunteering. Additionally, D-Lab, MISTI, etc. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Go out and explore more!</strong> Go to the Boston public library, walk around Boston, find nice
          places to work or study, etc. Additionally, make an effort to talk to people who I haven&#39;t met before, go
          to social events, etc. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Get Trained in the Breakerspace / Use Makerspaces more!</strong> Especially the Electronics Mezzanine
          to practice soldering / desoldering parts to see how they work </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Practice test-taking skills</strong> I think the best way to do this is to review a lot of problems
          and crucially,<em>time myself while I do them</em>. This way I also have the pressure of having to solve the
          problem in a certain amount of time. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Don&#39;t get an A in every class</strong>: This one might sound strange, but I think I spend too
          much time hyperoptimizing for GPA when I should be spending more time on the things that matter and less time
          on the things that don&#39;t. Thus, getting an A in all my classes is a sign that I&#39;m trying too hard in
          stuff that doesn&#39;t matter as much. At MIT, there are rarely easy A&#39;s, but there are some easy B&#39;s.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Devote regular time each day for a break/hobbies.</strong> Even if it&#39;s just for an hour, make
          sure to dedicate some time to Tamil practice, drawing, programming Eden, etc. Additionally, it can be
          something mindless, as this can also be productive as it can allow my brain to recharge. I will try to 
        journal/blog regularly. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The most important/general theme: </p>
