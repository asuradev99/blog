<p>Junior year, second semester. Taking a light load with Jlab. How am I progressing? </p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, I am doing pretty good in terms of meeting new people and going to social events. I&#39;ve already gone to a Christian discussion/debate-ish event, learnt how to make a metal pawn with a manual lathe, and met new people I usually don&#39;t talk to at the dining hall. I also went to a Hare Krishna event (by accident, I didn&#39;t know it was Hare krishna-variety) but that was also a new and fun experience for me (though I probably won&#39;t go back after chanting for 15 mins). </p>
</li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve also noticed that even with more free time, it is very easy to either a) do nothing, no good or bad goals or b) allow the things I do have to do to eat up a lot of time. It&#39;s also extremely easy to feel too lazy to go outside. I think in part this is encouraged unfortunately by the fact that I am at one of the furthest dorms from campus, Next House. I will work on incentivising going out more. I&#39;ve noticed that going out is usually the driver of what causes me to have new experiences. </p>
</li>
<li><p>I have been doing pretty well at working out and meditation. If there is one habit I want to keep up it is these. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Unfortunately I haven&#39;t been doing much music or art. I should looking into making my reward art-focused so I can buy myself something to incentivize doing more of it. </p>
</li>
<li><p>I started off doing well avoiding GrubHub, but unfortunately had gotten pulled back in. However, I don&#39;t think avoiding GrubHub should be my priority right now; I should focus on improving my mental health and worry about finances later. </p>
</li>
