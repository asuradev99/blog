      Random crackpot thought: there is no set boundary between the self and 
      the other there is no boundary between inner and external world there is no discrete 
      transition between the living and nonliving ultimately both is simply one continuous 
      substrate that is the universe What does this mean? Perhaps we are not necessarily 
      merely our mind and our physical bodies, but the sum total of the impact that we've had on the universe 
      -- "we" are also the physical influence that we've had on others, on society, on the world -- perhaps "we" 
      (not just our physical bodies) "live" (for some defition of live) on, through the sum total of our legacy, 
      long beyond the tiny sliver of time that we are mortally, consciously/biologically alive. 

      Additionally, today is the day before what will be perhaps the hardest exam I will ever take in my life, or at 
      least at MIT. This exam is the final exam for 8.05, Quantum Mechanics II, a notoriously hard class, at least, 
      by reputation. Overall I did quite well on the homeworks but my last exam didn't go great (but not terrible either). 
      I will probably get a B and will be okay with a B or higher. I studied quite hard for the exam and hope it goes well.
