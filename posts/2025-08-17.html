    <h1 id="list-of-social-norms">List of Social Norms</h1>
    <p>What does it mean to be &quot;normal&quot;? What behaviors are expected / not expected in a given situation? I
      have struggled with this question my whole life, sometimes in attempts to fit in, and sometimes not to. Most of us
      would probably say that there is no such thing as normal. However, based on my experience and observations, there
      is defitely a set of behaviors and social rules which are generally expected, and I will call this
      &quot;normal&quot; behavior or social norms. THe purpose of this possibly incomplete, possible redundant list is
      mostly descriptive; I am not trying to assign value judgements just yet. Additionally, this mostly refelcts my experience
      as a young adult in American society, and thus mostly focuses on American norms. </p>
