    <p>Daily notes for 2025-08-22.</p>

    I want to get better at <b>committing.</b> My whole life, 
    I've been really good a hyperfocusing on a particular task for a few weeks
    or sometimes months. But, inevitably, over time, I lose interests
    in improving / keeping up that tasks and I switch to a new task. 
    Or, I think that what I am doing is useless so get stuck in a 
    loop of switching back and forth between two strategies, which
    is inefficient. 

    <p>
    It's unfortunate that as finite beings, we have finite lives. Thus, 
    our time here is absolutely precious. To make better use of my 
    time, I need to commit to a few habits which will make my life a 
    bit easier. Such as: 
    
    <ul>
      <li> Sleeping consistently from 2 am to 8 am (Helps with everything). 

        <ul>
          <li> 
            A big part of this
            is not getting distracted and getting addicted to some show/audiobook before bed.  </li>

          <li>Additionally, I need to record and keep track of my sleep statistics every day.</li>

        </ul>
        
      </li>
      
      <li> Washing my glasses, hygeine, etc. (Helps study for longer) </li>
      <li> Stick to one and ONLY one textbook for self-studying and not switching back and forth between textbooks.</li>
      <li> Writing in this blog </li>
      <li> Taking time each week to work on my hobbies (drawing, programming, music, etc.)
      <li> Exercise every day, even if it's just a short jog. </li>
      <li> Make sure to eat at regular times. Eating at a regular time is a higher priority than even homework. </li>
      <li> Meditate for at least 15 mins every day. </li>

    </ul>
      
    General principle: <b> Consistency matters more than perfection. </b>
    This is hard for me to accept, being a perfectionist, but I think
    it is absolutely true.
