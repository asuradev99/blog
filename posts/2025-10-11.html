    <p>Just got around to reading some books on free will, namely Free Will by Sam Harris, The Delusion of Free Will by James. B. Miles, and Determined by Robert Sapolsky. Admittedly a pretty one-sided roster but I gotta start somewhere.</p>
    <p>Of the three I think the one I most agreed with (I'd say about 85%) was the Delusion of Free Will, because it spent a lot of time addressing the various forms of compatibilism in the most depth, which the other two, in my opinion, did not do as well. However it got somewhat abstract and philosophical in some parts and was not very engaging, so I got bored and skimmed many of the chapters.</p>
    <p>Free Will by Sam Harris is a good concise summary in my opinion of some of the major claims of anti free-will arguments. However I disagree with some of his own arguments that he puts forth, for instance I think his thought experiments and some of his examples are quite misleading and are not sufficient to lend evidence to lack of free will -- most notably, I think his argument still needs to depend on some form of physical determinism + quantum randomness to work. This is related to the discussion I had with Jack earlier but I'm currently too lazy to reread it.</p>
    <p>In terms of Determined, I think the book does a good job at highlighting the coherent causes of our behavior and encouraging thinking more critically about the long-term reasons why we do what we do, but in my opinion a major mistake he makes is thinking that everything has a coherent cause which can be explained by neuroscience/psychology/etc. -- this is not plausible at all and will likely never be true -- I think a more robust argument is simply the fact that there is always an underlying physical deterministic cause, and it has no need to be explainable to us for it to exist. It also doesn't address compatibilism that much, mostly assumes a libertarian form of free will.</p>
