<p>Aditya, </p>
<p>its me. you. yes, you. But you from the past. Me. Your 18-year old self hear to bug you. Remember me? All those years ago, a few days before you head out for MIT. It will be something that has inevitably changed your life, perhaps for the better or for the worse. </p>
<p>well, what I wanted to tell you was this. past you is scared. He&#39;s scared that hell drown in an unfamiliar, foreign place, with nothing but his own false hope and failed promises to latch onto. He&#39;s seen the giants, the geniuses, the tinkerers, a whole other world full of people that are not only like him but beyond him. </p>
<p>it&#39;s as though I&#39;ve been in a bubble for my whole life, the bubble of salt lake city, utah. I&#39;ll admit it was a nice, comfortable bubble, cradled between the wasatch mountains and desert beyond. I&#39;ve lived my whole life here simply to have my bubble popped in a day and let the rest of the world flood in. </p>
<p>strangely, while being scared, I still feel an emptiness inside me, not sadness or excitement, but the emptiness of purely not knowing what to feel, what to expect, even, to feel. The people who I&#39;ve lived with and the places I&#39;ve known my whole life, continually, will be gone for a long time, practically in a heartbeat, in 4 days. I&#39;ll have to learn how to live on my own, and that, more than anything, is something that frightens me. </p>
<p>There&#39;s something I need from you. I want you to promise me something. I know I cannot guarantee that you have become a star student, a prodigy of math, computer science, or physics, a brilliant engineer, or a talented musician and visual artist. I cannot hope for all these things. But what I can hope for are two things. </p>
<p>first, be good to yourself others. Go through the motions of civilized society, such as showering and brushing teeth. Take care of yourself when you get sick. Don&#39;t beat yourself up if you get stuck or don&#39;t do as well as others. But more importantly-- perhaps if there is one thing that I believe is more important than being a great man, it is being a good son, brother, and friend. Call your family regularly (weekly!!). Talk to people, make friends! Be a genuine person that others can rely on. </p>
<p>Second, stay humble and curious. The pretests I have done have demonstrated only that there is an entire universe full of information for you to explore, and it should not be squandered at the cost of ego or insecurity. Never lose that little spark of curiosity inside you that itches you, tugs on you, to explore the mysteries of the world. Never lose the passion, the little flame in the dark that wells up inside you, the message that only you and I, my dear self, can understand. Never forget that.n</p>
