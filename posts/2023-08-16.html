    <p>I've been reading a biography of Alan Turing and it's fascinating how much of the future of AI and early development of computers he predicted WAY before its time.
      For example: he was the one who really put forth a stored program computer concept much before von Neumann did, as it's origins could be found in his Church-Turing thesis in which he laid out the universality of Turing machines.
      This allowed him to embrace the notion of a general purpose computer as well as the RISC philosophy as opposed to more specialized machines.
      Come to think of it, von Neumann really should have given Turing more credit especially for the stored program idea.
      Turing conceived of his own computer design, the ACE, concurrently to the IAS team which was theoretically more efficient and practical, but its development was unfortunately held up by bureaucratic bluster. 
      He also predicted the general philosophy of machine learning and his Turing test is still used as an indicator of how human-like AI is (even though I disagree with this test's validity).
      He also predicted the utility of programming languages
      by conceiving of subroutines consisting of multiple base instructions
      It's a shame that Turing's practical work largely evolved in parallel to American developments in the mid 1900s rather than in cooperation.
      Turing had the ideas, but America had the industry and economy to kickstart the computer revolution.
      Also, Turing is a rare kind of theoretical who deals with very abstract mathematical concepts (mathematical logic mostly) and yet conceived numerous practical applications for them as well, bridging the two paradigms of mathematics and engineering.
      Von Neumann notably was another one of such people.
      Most of Turing's ideas found ample opportunities to be realized physically in the form of machines (bombe, Colossus, Delilah, ace, etc)
