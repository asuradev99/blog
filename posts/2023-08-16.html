    <p>Ive been reading a biography of Alan turing and it's fascinating how much of the future of AI and early development of computers he predicted WAY before it's time
      For example: he was the one who really put forth a stored program computer concept much before von Neumann did, as it's origins could be found in his church-turing thesis in which he laid out the universality of turing machinrs
      This allowed him to embrace the notion of a general purpose computer as well as the RISC philosophy as opposed to more specialized machines
      Come to think of it, von Neumann really should have given Turing more credit especially for the stored program idea
      Turing conceived of his own computer design, the ACE, concurrently to the IAS team which was theoretically more efficient and practical, but it's development was unfortunately held up by beurocratic bluster 
      He also predicted the general philosophy of machine learning and his turing test is still used as an indicator of how human-like AI is (even though I disagree with this tests validity)
      He also predicted the utility of programming languages 
      Be conceiving of subroutines consisting of multiple base instructions
      It's a shame that Turings practical work largely involved in parallel to American developments in the mid 1900s rather than in cooperation
      Turing had the ideas, but america had the industry and economy to kickstart the computer revolution
      Also, turing is a rare kind of theoretical who deals with very abstract mathematical concepts (mathematical logic mostly) and yet conceived numerous practical applications for them as well, bridging the two paradigms of mathematics and engineering
      Von Neumann notably was another one of such people
      Most of turings ideas found ample opportunities to be realized physically in the form of machines (bombe, Colossus, Delilah, ace, etc)
