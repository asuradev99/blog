    <p>Daily notes for 2025-12-20.</p>
    Out understanding of reality comprised of different "levels" of abstraction or understanding. 
    Different levels each make their own assumptions, simplifications, models, and conclusions about the way that the world works. 

For instance, we go about our lives thinking about ourselves in many layers of abstraction. At the everyday level, for pragmatic purposes we sometimes treat "ourselves" and other humans as fundamental or axioms, and think about various facets of human behavior, such as actions, words, and emotions, social norms, as given. 

But when problems arise, such as with our physical or mental wellbeing we sometimes revert to a slightly lower level of abstraction, including facets of human biology such as the brain, our medical conditions, our peripherals. Now, a person is no longer the basic axiomatic object, as it is composed of more fundamental biological parts that follow certain rules or tendencies of their own. 

Sometimes we raise our awareness to higher levels of abstraction, that involve grouping together multiple people into one "unit" of abstraction. This comes when thinking about organizations, institutions, countries, cultures, basically anything that involves groups of humans. Then, we talk about the interactions between these groups while compartmentalizing interactions within those groups.

It is tempting to think of these layers as being organized in a kind of heirarchy, or tower, with the most abstract and high-level layer being at the very surface while the deepest level being at the very bottom, and that the layers above are entirely at the mercy of the above layers. 

I think a better analogy is rather different ways of looking at the same painting: you can zoom in up close, seeing the individual pixels or brush strokes, or you could zoom out, seeing the overall shape or form of the picture. Both are different ways of looking at the same thing,but one is not entirely contingent on another. Each perspective contributes something new: looking up close allows you to see in fine grained detail the fundamental elements that make up the painting, brush strokes or the testure of the canvas, the specific colors used; while zooming out allows you to perhaps gauge the broader style or "feeling" of the painting.


What happens whentwo different levels conflict? When one level says something that the other does not?
