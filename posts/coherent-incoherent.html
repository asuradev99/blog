    <p>I've been thinking about free will again and had a (in my opinoin) important distinction: between incoherent and coherent causes. The overall structure of my argument and how it applies to this distinction is as follows: I claim that q-determinism says every event you could possibly think of has a q-determnistic cause. But that cause need not be _coherent_, or easily interpretable by humans. For instance, it could simply be that the reason you acted the way you did was because a cosmic ray hit your brain in just the right way to have a domino effect to alighn the chemical gradients in the neuron in your brain to precisely fire in just the right way .... .you get the idea. There is no way for us to interpret this as part of a larger pattern, i.e. "cosmic rays cause hallucinations" or something like that -- it was a purely one-off event, effectively random for our purposes. Also it's important to note that all events are at least incoherent, because if you zoomed in with a microscope on what was happening at the level eof atoms/particles/etc, for any action, you would always find something (to the best of our current ability) that is completely incoherent.</p>
    <p>I think there is often the misconception that determinism, by itself, needs to provide coherent causes for everything. I.e, there is a grand lookup table that says, you did X? well, you must have had this particular gene or this particular environmental influence or that particular atom bumped into this molecular that directly lead to you doing this behavior. Obviously such a table is impossible to construct, and that's why there is very common argument that involves providing a counterexample to these kind of rules, for ex: "not all abusers are abused".</p>
    <p>I think it is at first glance a fair criticism that determinism lacks explanatory power. To be clear, I don't think determinism will ever have the kind of explanatory power to provide such a lookup table. But for me, the point of determinism is not the explanatory power at a high level, but rigid constaints it sets at the lower levels of molecules and atoms and quantum wavefunctions. Most people accept that, at the most fundamental level, we still obey the same laws of physics. Indeed, q-determinism says, that at this level, everything could only do what it had to do and not otherwise (modulo quantum randomness). Thus, the lower-level physics constrains higher-level systems: if a system as a whole can do otherwise, then surely at least one of it's lower-level components can do otherwise (in order to allow the higher-level system to do otherwise), which lead to a contradiction with the microscopic laws of physics. Therefore by reduction ad absurdum the higher-level system cannot metaphysically do otherwise either -- a complete explanation of the higher-level system is not necessary.</p>
    <p>Ok, but now we are left in a world where one-off events like cosmic particles can spontaneously cause hallucinations or butterflies can cause tsunamies, right? Why try and predict anything at all? Determinism doesn't prevent us from living in a universe where everything is incoherent, i.e. imagine we are inside a giant gas, with indistinguisable particles zooming around and bouncing off each other in every which way - we have no idea how to explain the trajectory of an individual gas particle without resorting to simulating the entire system. Why try and change our behavior when everything is completely chaotic and random? Well, here is where the lookup table we have already constructed, ala Robert Sapolsky, comes in. While we may not be able to explain or predict every scenario, neuroscience, biology, and psychology, sociology, etc. are not completely useless, and they have identified useful higher-level societal or behavioral patterns which are not just one-off occurrences. Indeed, nature providing us with these imperfect but nonetheless useful higher-level trends is the whole reason why science is possible and useful in the first place.</p>
    <p>So, in summary, while determinism will never have perfect explanatory power, what it does provide is the constraint upon higher-level systems such that they cannot do otherwise -- i.e., everything has at least an incoherent deterministic cause. Combine with this the plethora of evidence that our universe does reveal coherent causes to phenomena, and we as a society have enough of a reason to approach actions/events which we don't immediately understand the cause of with an attitude not of "well, it must have happened by choice" but rather "could there be some deeper coherent cause which helps explain this situation".</p>
