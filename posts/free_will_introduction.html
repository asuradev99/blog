    <h1>Introduction to My Thoughts on Free Will</h1>
    <div id="post-meta"></div>
    <p>Everyday, we make choices. Not just any choices, but often conscious, deliberate, ones. Ones where we can <em>feel</em> ourselves <em>choosing</em> between several alternatives. What to wear, what to eat, what to buy, where to go, etc. Sometimes, we make good decisions, decisions that we are proud of or other people are proud of, and sometimes we make bad decisions that we are ashamed of. Sometimes, the decisions of others angers us greatly, to the point where we <em>blame</em> them as <em>morally responsible</em> for their actions, because they &quot;could have done otherwise&quot;. Since the dawn of storytelling itself, our songs and works of fiction sing of the great deeds of heroes who chose good and the wicked ones villains who chose evil. As a society, we change the trajectory of people&#39;s entire lives through the judgement of how much their action was attributed to their own conscious, deliberate, <em>free</em> thought, through the informal mechanisms of social praise and blame, as well as the formal mechanisms of the justice system. It is often said that we are defined by the choices we make.</p>
<p>What does it all mean? What does it mean to choose? Why do we choose the things we do? To what extent are our choices &quot;free&quot;, and what are they free from? And what broader implications do our choices have, on the way that we live, judge, blame, and in general organize our governing principles around?</p>
<p>These questions are at the heart of the problem of free will. </p>
<p>In my experience, when most people hear about the problem of &quot;free will&quot;, their attitude is one of disinterest -- it&#39;s just another one of those seemingly obvious but apparently nontrivial conundrums that only matters to armchair philosophers with too much time on their hands. Most people, probably already know their own answer to the question: of course they have it! Of course we have free will, it&#39;s obvious. We make &quot;free&quot; choices much of(but not necessarily all of) the time, for some definition of free will. Additionally, not only do we make free choices, we are also responsible for them, deserving of blame and praise. I can partially relate to the underlying  sentiment. In general, I am not very interested in the problems that philosophers are interested in. Personally,  I think that most philosophical problems fail to capture the nuance of real life or entail any practical or useful implications for the way we should go about our lives -- we can afford to not care or hold an opinion about many of these problems with no serious consequence. </p>
<p>I would like to argue, however, in the following blog posts, that the same cannot be said of free will. The question of free will is not just a philosophical question; it is a question which is relevant to anyone whose choices (or the choices of others) matter to them. It is relevant to scientists, politicians, sociologists, criminal workers, activisists, etc. and most importantly -- you. </p>
<p>I would also like to argue that the question of whether our decisions are freely-willed is not so simple as we think. In fact, I think that the dominant view of free will -- that it exists, is completely, utterly, totally, wrong. That every single decision we do -- from choosing what to eat for breakfast to choosing to murder someone in cold blood -- is completely, utterly, totally, without free will. Also, not only is free will not the case, we are also better off as a society <em>not</em> believing in it. This may be a very contrarian, or outlandish, or extreme take -- but in the following blog posts, I hope to, at the very least, make you understand (but not necessarily agree with) why <em>I</em> believe what I do. </p>
<p>The question of free will has plagued me for many years. I have always been skeptical of the concept of free will, even before I started to study physics or think about the problem of free will deeply; but I didn&#39;t fully take seriously the consequences of not having free will. Recently, I have spent many nearly sleepless nights thinking about this issue, wondering if I am crazy insane or the whole world (at least, the vast majority of it) is wrong in their understanding of human nature. I have not met a single person who thinks the same way about this issue as I do -- the vast majority of society tells me that I am completely wrong on this topic. So, in writing these posts, if I am wrong, at least hopefully I will come to understand <em>exactly</em> why I am wrong by enumerating in detail all of my thoughts and arguments. </p>
<p>Here, I will also include a summary of the main points of my argument, which I will elaborate on in future posts. They are the following: </p>
<h2 id="thesis-we-should-not-believe-in-free-will">Thesis: We should not believe in free will</h2>
<p><strong><em>0.</em> Framing of the debate: both sides (free will exists/is useful, versus free will doesn&#39;t exist/is not useful) must provide evidence, both positive (directly supports their own claim) and negative (disproves arguments from the other side), for their position. Neither side has the total burden of proof.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. There is not sufficient empirical nor philosophical evidence to establish that libertarian free will exists, and there is a great deal of evidence supporting the idea that it doesn&#39;t. Therefore, we should not believe in LFW, and we should believe that the world is fundamentally deterministic, with perhaps a bit of indeterministic randomness. </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Forms of compatibilist free will (CFW) are incompatible with moral responsibility, therefore, we should not use it when making moral judgements, and thus it is generally not a useful framework for thinking about human behavior.</strong></p>
<p>**3. In place of LFW and CFW, adopting a determinist mindset about human nature and the ethics of moral responsibility does not necessarily lead to various existential crises, such as fatalism, nihilism, or collapse of the ethics or society. </p>
<p><strong>4. Embracing a deterministic mindset about human nature and will lead to a better, more compassionate, and more equitable society; therefore, we should not purposely hide this mindset (illusionism). </strong> </p>
